# Contributing

Please fork, add specs, and send pull requests! Do keep in mind that this is a generic project, so please keep your specs as generic as possible so they can be re-used in other projects.

## Code format & ESLint
The project contains a [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) and [eslint](http://eslint.org/) configuration file, builds will run eslint with this configuration. To run eslint localy use the following command:

```sh
$ eslint test/**/*.js
```

## Note
Currently not all [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/) commands are mapped and implemented as snippets. Any contributions that adds new snippets + test are highly welcome.
